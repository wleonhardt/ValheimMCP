## [Unreleased] - Hubner fork

- Core: tool registry (`ToolRegistry.cs`) and hot-reloadable extension host (`ExtensionHost.cs`); per-tool write gating.
- `ext/`: the Hubner extension (world reading, idempotent plan building, walking and rendering verification, environment control, chat capture) for client and dedicated server.
- `python/`: MCP client and helpers; `config/`: example client and server configs.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-25

- Bump bepinex dep for 5.4.2351

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-09

- Bump bepinex dependencies for Valheim 1.0 release


## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- `get_log` MCP tool (and `GET /log` route): fetch recent lines from an in-memory
  log ring buffer on demand — tail the log, including on a dedicated server whose
  `LogOutput.log` isn't directly accessible. Supports incremental polling via a
  `cursor`/`since` and filtering via `contains`/`regex`. Complements the blocking
  `wait_for_log`.
- `LogWatch` now retains a bounded ring buffer of recent formatted log lines
  (configurable via `log.bufferCapacity` / `log.defaultLines` / `log.maxLines`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- Standalone BepInEx plugin exposing a localhost HTTP endpoint for driving
  Valheim's in-game console.
- Plain HTTP routes for scripting: `GET /health`, `GET /commands`,
  `POST /command`.
- Native in-process MCP transport (`POST /mcp`, Streamable-HTTP / JSON-RPC 2.0)
  with tools: `run_command`, `list_commands`, `health`, `render_view`.
- Off-screen camera rendering (`render_view`) returning a PNG inline, without
  touching the player's view.
- Dependency-free config at `BepInEx/config/valheimmcp.yml`, including an
  `allow`/`deny` command access-control list.

### Known limitations
- Output from commands that print asynchronously (coroutines, e.g. screenshot
  capture) is not captured — only output printed synchronously during the call.
